# seafile-rpi-unofficial
Unofficial releases of seafile for raspberry pi

Official releases are often outdated so I put here versions that I compile. I know they are looking for builders but I don't have enough time and Linux verions are limited on Odroid C4.

To build on focal use of 'python-is-python3' package is needed.
